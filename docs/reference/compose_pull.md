## Description

Pulls an image associated with a service defined in a `compose.yaml` file, but does not start containers based on 
those images.


## Examples 

suppose you have this `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
  web:
    build: .
    command: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'
    volumes:
      - .:/myapp
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
```

If you run `docker compose pull ServiceName` in the same directory as the `compose.yaml` file that defines the service, 
Docker pulls the associated image. For example, to call the postgres image configured as the db service in our example, 
you would run `docker compose pull db`.

```console
$ docker compose pull db
