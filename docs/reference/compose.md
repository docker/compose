## Examples

### Use `-f` to specify the name and path of one or more Compose files
Use the `-f` flag to specify the location of a Compose configuration file.

#### Specifying multiple Compose files
You can supply multiple `-f` configuration files. When you supply multiple files, Compose combines them into a single
configuration. Compose builds the configuration in the order you supply the files. Subsequent files override and add
to their predecessors.

For example, consider this command line:

```console
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.admin.yml run backup_db
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file might specify a `webapp` service.

```yaml
services:
  webapp:
    image: examples/web
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - "/data"
```
If the `docker-compose.admin.yml` also specifies this same service, any matching fields override the previous file.
New values, add to the `webapp` service configuration.

```yaml
services:
  webapp:
    build: .
    environment:
      - DEBUG=1
```

When you use multiple Compose files, all paths in the files are relative to the first configuration file specified
with `-f`. You can use the `--project-directory` option to override this base path.

Use a `-f` with `-` (dash) as the filename to read the configuration from stdin. When stdin is used all paths in the
configuration are relative to the current working directory.

The `-f` flag is optional. If you donâ€™t provide this flag on the command line, Compose traverses the working directory
and its parent directories looking for a `compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yaml` file.

#### Specifying a path to a single Compose file
You can use the `-f` flag to specify a path to a Compose file that is not located in the current directory, either
from the command line or by setting up a `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable in your shell or in an environment file.

For an example of using the `-f` option at the command line, suppose you are running the Compose Rails sample, and
have a `compose.yaml` file in a directory called `sandbox/rails`. You can use a command like `docker compose pull` to
get the postgres image for the db service from anywhere by using the `-f` flag as follows:

```console
$ docker compose -f ~/sandbox/rails/compose.yaml pull db
```

### Use `-p` to specify a project name

Each configuration has a project name. Compose sets the project name using
the following mechanisms, in order of precedence:
- The `-p` command line flag
- The `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable
- The top level `name:` variable from the config file (or the last `name:`
from a series of config files specified using `-f`)
- The `basename` of the project directory containing the config file (or
containing the first config file specified using `-f`)
- The `basename` of the current directory if no config file is specified
Project names must contain only lowercase letters, decimal digits, dashes,
and underscores, and must begin with a lowercase letter or decimal digit. If
the `basename` of the project directory or current directory violates this
constraint, you must use one of the other mechanisms.

```console
$ docker compose -p my_project ps -a
NAME                 SERVICE    STATUS     PORTS
my_project_demo_1    demo       running

$ docker compose -p my_project logs
demo_1  | PING localhost (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
demo_1  | 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.095 ms
```

### Use profiles to enable optional services

Use `--profile` to specify one or more active profiles
Calling `docker compose --profile frontend up` starts the services with the profile `frontend` and services
without any specified profiles.
You can also enable multiple profiles, e.g. with `docker compose --profile frontend --profile debug up` the profiles `frontend` and `debug` is enabled.

Profiles can also be set by `COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable.

### Configuring parallelism

Use `--parallel` to specify the maximum level of parallelism for concurrent engine calls.
Calling `docker compose --parallel 1 pull` pulls the pullable images defined in the Compose file
one at a time. This can also be used to control build concurrency.

Parallelism can also be set by the `COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT` environment variable.

### Set up environment variables

You can set environment variables for various docker compose options, including the `-f`, `-p` and `--profiles` flags.

Setting the `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable is equivalent to passing the `-f` flag,
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable does the same as the `-p` flag,
`COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable is equivalent to the `--profiles` flag
and `COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT` does the same as the `--parallel` flag.

If flags are explicitly set on the command line, the associated environment variable is ignored.

Setting the `COMPOSE_IGNORE_ORPHANS` environment variable to `true` stops docker compose from detecting orphaned
containers for the project.

Setting the `COMPOSE_MENU` environment variable to `false` disables the helper menu when running `docker compose up`
in attached mode. Alternatively, you can also run `docker compose up --menu=false` to disable the helper menu.

### Use Dry Run mode to test your command

Use `--dry-run` flag to test a command without changing your application stack state.
Dry Run mode shows you all the steps Compose applies when executing a command, for example:
```console
$ docker compose --dry-run up --build -d

```
From the example above, you can see that the first step is to pull the image defined by `db` service, then build the `backend` service.  
Next, the containers are created. The `db` service is started, and the `backend` and `proxy` wait until the `db` service is healthy before starting.

Dry Run mode works with almost all commands. You cannot use Dry Run mode with a command that doesn't change the state of a Compose stack such as `ps`, `ls`, `logs` for example.
