	# The Core maintainers are the ghostbusters of the project: when there's a problem others
	# can't solve, they show up and fix it with bizarre devices and weaponry.
	# They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
	# They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
	# bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
	# a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
	# subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.
